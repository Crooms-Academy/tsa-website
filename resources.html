                <p class="brief">
                    For our fictional band, the Bartch Trees, we wanted to create a modern, beautiful website that is informational.
                    We did this by creating a website in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. We decided to divide the content into four main pages.
                    The first one is the home page, which provides an into to the information. The about page provides a background to the history of our band.
                    The news page provides updates to our band members. The shop page allows our fans to purchase merchandise.
